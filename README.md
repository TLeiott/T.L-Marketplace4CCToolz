# T.L Marketplace for Claude Code Tools

A Claude Code plugin marketplace providing .NET development pipeline tools.

## What's Included

### T.L-AutoDevelop (v2.3.0) — Interactive

An interactive development pipeline that orchestrates Claude Code through plan, semantic plan validation, investigation, implementation, preflight, and review — with user confirmations before each commit.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/develop [task]` | Single task with user confirmations before commit |
| `/develop-batch [tasks.md]` | Batched git-worktree pipeline with capped parallelism, confirms each commit |

### T.L-AutoDevelop-Pro (v2.3.0) — Autonomous

A fully autonomous development pipeline — zero confirmations. Runs plan, investigation, implement, preflight, review, and commit end-to-end unattended.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/TLA-develop [task]` | Single task, zero confirmations, auto-commit |
| `/TLA-develop-batch [tasks.md]` | Batched pipeline with capped parallelism, fully automated end-to-end |

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Plan -> Plan Validate -> Investigate -> Implement -> Change Validate -> Preflight -> Review
```

**New runtime behavior:**
- Explicit no-op categories instead of generic `IMPL_FAIL`
- Per-run artifacts under `.claude-develop-logs/runs/<taskName>/`
- Investigation phase for ambiguous or diagnostic tasks
- Semantic plan validation that rejects placeholder/template plans
- Batch launchers should cap concurrency at 2 simultaneous pipelines

## Prerequisites

- **Windows** (PowerShell 5.1+)
- **.NET SDK** (for `dotnet build`)
- **Git** (with worktree support)
- **Claude CLI** installed and authenticated
